    <p>Michigan Electronic Public Records Access Act Notice</p>
</header>

<main>
    <div class="card">
        Under the Michigan Electronic Public Records Access Act, otherwise known as the MEPRAA, county and state public bodies are only required to maintain general records electronically. You have requested to view records for a jurisdiction legally defined as a CITY/TOWNSHIP/VILLAGE, specifically the CITY OF FLINT, which is located within GENESEE COUNTY in the STATE OF MICHIGAN.

        <br><br>

        Because the requested jurisdiction is defined as a municipality, it has no legal obligation to provide a public electronic database. You may contact the municipal government if you wish to request that they voluntarily opt in to providing electronic access.

        <br><br>

        However, under the Freedom of Information Act, you are still entitled to the right to request records from the municipal government and all public bodies within the jurisdiction.
